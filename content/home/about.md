# About

I'm a passionate software engineer with a broad experience in software development.  
Almost all of my projects were greenfield with modern agile methodologies, like: Scrum, Continuous Integration, TDD, and DevOps stuff.  
Also I had a chance to be involved into all phases of a project's life cycle: starting from requirements definition and design till deployment on production and application support.

Due to full-stack position, which I have been occupying for several years I have experience with both technologies: front-end and back-end.  
All of that allows me to have a broad vision of a whole system, but not only a separate part of it.
